# weather-app

This Flask app provides users with up-to-date weather forecast information for any location they specify. The user simply inputs the desired location, which is then automatically converted into its associated latitude and longitude using a geocoding API. The application then uses the Open-Meteo API to retrieve a 10-day forecast for the specified location, providing the user with detailed information on temperature, precipitation, and UV index. The forecast information is displayed using interactive line charts powered by Chart.js.
